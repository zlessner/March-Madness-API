# March-Madness-API

Every March Madness bracket has the potential to win its respective pool. However, 
some brackets have much better chances than others. With this March Madness API, data from [FiveThirtyEight's](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-march-madness-predictions/) trusty March Madness Model can be compared against the picks [Yahoo](https://tournament.fantasysports.yahoo.com/t1/pickdistribution) users chose this year. Navigate through the percentage of people who chose each team to go each round, and compare that against the odds FiveThirtyEight gave of those scenarios occuring.
